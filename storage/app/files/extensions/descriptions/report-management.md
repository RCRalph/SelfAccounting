This extension allows you to create and share reports with **other users**. A report is created by combining results from entered queries and entries specific to the report, then it is presented as a table sorted by dates and titles. You can also not share your reports with anyone and keep them for **personal usage**.

Make sure that users that you are sharing your reports to own this extension as well, otherwise they won't be able to see what you share with them.
