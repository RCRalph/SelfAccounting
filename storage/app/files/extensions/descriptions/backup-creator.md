This extension allows you to easily backup your data and then restore it in case of an emergency. The backup includes:
- **Your accounts**
- **Your categories**
- **Your income**
- **Your expenses**
- **Your transfers**
- **Your extensions**

As more extensions are developed, this extension will be updated with all data stored by them.

Bare in mind that you can only restore your data if your account is older than 30 days old. In case of an emergency you of course can contact the developer, who will allow you to restore your data. This feature prevents new users from overloading the database.
