# Starting out
Congratulations! You just created your own SelfAccounting account! Here are some things that you should do to make your experience even more incredible:

## Check out darkmode
To switch between darkmode and lightmode, click on the icon of sun or moon in the upper-right corner of the screen and see which one works best for you. The setting you choose will be used throughout every webpage here and can be changed any time you want! Throught this tutorial I will be using the darkmode version of the page, but your choice won't have any effect on the rest of the tutorial.

## Change your profile picture
To change your profile picture, click on your temporary profile picture (upper-right corner of the screen) and choose **View profile**, or click on [this link](/profile). Then click on the **Profile picture** labeled field, select your profile picture and click **Save changes**. The page will reload and after it does you'll see your new profile picture!

## When you're done
Follow this tutorial closely, this will help you get the maximum out of the app!

# Settings
Before anything else, you should enter your categories and means of payment. In this part of the tutorial you will learn how to do it:

## Enter settings page
To enter the settings page, click **Settings** tab on the navigation bar at the top or click on [this link](/settings). After that choose your currency using the field to the right of the screen:
![Currency select statement position](https://i.imgur.com/HhI9UKk.png)
The latest currency you used in income / outcome will later be used to automatically select your currency. You can add categories and means of payment for multiple currencies, just make sure you are adding them to the correct one. After that follow the intructions below. It is important to add these before entering any income or outcome, because then you won't have to edit your data in the future.

## Enter categories
Categories are groups in which your income / outcome splits into. Some example categories:
- Food,
- Entertainment,
- Car maintenance,
- Presents

To create new categories, click the **New category** button. A new table row will show up, which includes fields such as:
- **Name** - The name of your category, max 32 characters long. It doesn't have to be unique, but it's a good idea to have diffrent names of your categories.
- **Income** - Should this category be an income category. If chosen, this category will show up when you add, see or edit your income.
- **Outcome** - Should this category be an outcome category. If chosen, this category will show up when you add, see or edit your outcome.
- **Summary** - If chosen, the two date fields to the right will be unlocked. This option allows you to count the outcome with this category with dates between the two dates to the right. This option is only useful when you for example spent some money but you are certain you will have them back in some time. Otherwise I advice not selecting it.
- **Start date** - Only available if the **Summary** option is selected. It marks the inclusive start of counting to summary. 
- **End date** - Only available if the **Summary** option is selected. It marks the inclusive end of counting to summary. 

To delete a category, click the trashbin to the right of the row which you want to delete. The buttons below the table do the following things:
- **New category** - Creates a new row in the table. You can create as many categories as you like. To create categories with a different currency, just change the currency field shown above.
- **Reset changes** - Resets changes to the latest saved categories. **Caution:** If you are entering categories for the first time, this button will delete all your work if you haven't previously saved it!
- **Save changes** - Saves your categories, so you can access them when entering income or outcome. This button also resets the checkpoint of your **Reset changes** button. This button will be disabled if there is invaid data given above. You must correct your data before you can submit it. 

## Enter means of payment
Means of payment are the ways in which you get, store and spend money. Some example means of payment:
- Bank account,
- Cash,
- PayPal

Please note that every mean that you enter should point to a different place where you store money, for example if you have a debit card connected to your bank account, where you also make money transfers, enter just the **Bank account** mean of payment, instead of **Debit card** and **Money transfers**. This way, when you enter the [summary page](/summary), you will see how much money do you exactly have, which is what this page was intended to do from the beginning.

To create new means of payment, click the **New mean of payment** button. A new table row will show up, which includes fields such as:
- **Name** - The name of your mean of payment, max 32 categories long. It doesn't have to be unique, but it's a good idea to have diffrent names of your means of payment.
- **Income** - Should this mean of payment be an income mean of payment. If chosen, this mean of payment will show up when you add, see or edit your income.
- **Outcome** - Should this mean of payment be an outcome mean of payment. If chosen, this mean of payment will show up when you add, see or edit your outcome.
- **Summary** - Should this mean of payment be counted to summary. If chosen, this mean of payment will show up on the [summary page](/summary).
- **First entry** - The date, when you started monitoring your balance. Let's imagine a situation, where you decided to count up all your money and wrote it down somewhere. Then when you bought something or got money from somewhere, you noted down how much money you spent or got. The first entry date is the date of you counting the money. You don't know what happened to your money before that nor how much money you had before. No income or outcome can be entered using this mean of payment with date earlier than the entered one here. This of course can be changed later.
- **Starting balance** - The amount, which you had when you started monitoring your balance. Please refer to the story given in the previous point. The precision of this amount is two decimal places.

To delete a mean of payment, click the trashbin to the right of the row which you want to delete. The buttons below the table do the following things:
- **New mean of payment** - Creates a new row in the table. You can create as many means of payment as you like. To create means of payment with a different currency, just change the currency field shown above.
- **Reset changes** - Resets changes to the latest saved means of payment. **Caution:** If you are entering means of payment for the first time, this button will delete all your work if you haven't previously saved it!
- **Save changes** - Saves your means of payment, so you can access them when entering income or outcome. This button also resets the checkpoint of your **Reset changes** button. This button will be disabled if there is invaid data given above. You must correct your data before you can submit it. 

**Caution:** Remember to save your changes, otherwise all your work will be lost.

# Income / Outcome
The [income](/income) and [outcome](/outcome) pages are mostly the same, so everything within this section applies to both of them.

## Enter income / outcome page
To enter the income / outcome page, click **Income** / **Outcome** tab on the navigation bar at the top, or click links above. This will redirect you to the page, where all of your income / outcome will be shown. If you're following this tutorial from the beginning, the only think you will see is text *Nothing to see here, for now...*. This means that you haven't entered any income / outcome yet. Above this text there are two buttons, one says **Add multiple income / outcome** and the other says **Add single income / outcome**. 

## Add multiple income / outcome
The **Add multiple income / outcome** page is separated into two sections by a horizontal line: the **Common values** section and **Entries** section. The **Common values** section includes fields such as:
- **Date** - The date of your income. It cannot come earlier than the first entry date given in the settings page.
- **Title** - The title of your income / outcome, the max length is 64 characters.
- **Amount** - The amount of your income / outcome. Imagine you bought **2** chocolate bars for **5 USD** each. In this case you would put **2** in the amount field. The absolute value of the amount has to be less than one million. The precision is 3 decimal places.
- **Price** - This field includes a number field and a select field. Please refer to the previous story, in this case you would put 5 in the number field and would select USD as your currency. The absolute value of the price has to be less than 100 billion. The precision is two decimal places.
- **Category** - Choose your category that you previously entered in the [settings](/settings) page. If you don't want your income / outcome to be associated with any category, just select the **NULL** option.
- **Mean of payment** - Choose your mean of payment that you previously entered in the [settings](/settings) page. If you don't want your income / outcome to be associated with any mean of payment, just select the **NULL** option.

The values that you set in the **Common values** section will be the same throughout every single entry that you will create below. In the **Entries section** (below the solid horizonal line), you can enter values for the individual income / outcome data. The ones specified in the **Common values** section will be locked. To add a new entry, click the **New income / outcome** button. To delete an entry, click the **Delete** button. To save the entered entries, click the **Submit** button. This button will be disabled if there is invaid data given above. You must correct your data before you can submit it. 

## Add single income / outcome
The **Add single income / outcome** page is a much simpler way of entering your income / outcome. It is pretty much the same as the other one, so if you want information about this particular page, refer to the *Add multiple income / outcome* section.

## Edit or delete income / outcome
To edit your income / outcome, go to the [income](/income) / [outcome](/outcome) page. Then click the icon to the right of the income / outcome, which you want to edit:
![Icon next to the selected income / outcome](https://i.imgur.com/zJ9pJpR.png)
Then make the edits you want. Using this view you can also delete this entry. To do that, click the **Delete income / outcome** button. If you changed your mind and you want to reset your changes, click the **Reset changes** button. If you want to save your edits, click the **Save changes** button.

# Summary
To access the **Summary** view, click on the SelfAccounting logo on the navigation bar, or click [this link](/summary). The point of this view is to show your current balance. If you entered your first entry amounts in the means of payment correctly and you precisely monitored your income and outcome, you should see the amounts corresponding to your actual balance.

# Bundles
Bundles allow you to expand the application with addidional functions and pages. To see the list of them, click **Bundles** tab on the navigation bar at the top or click on [this link](/bundles). Then if you find any interesting bundles you can click on one.
## Acquiring a bundle
To acquire a bundle, you need to either purchase it by clicking the **Buy now** button or, if you are a Premium user, click the **Start using with premium** button. After you aquired the bundle by using it with Premium, refresh the page. Then click **Bundles** tab on the navigation bar, a dropdown should pop up. After that click on the name of the bundle you just acquired. Now you should see the main page of your bundle.

# Premium
Premium mainly allows you to get access to every available bundle. The cost of it is €1.5 per month or €15 per year. 10% of all the money made from the site goes to Wikimedia Foundation. You can read more about premium [here](/premium). Every user after registering gets 30 days of premium for free.
