This view will show you the current state of your finances, including how much money do you currently have.

In the **Last 30 days** panel you will see charts that visualize your income and expences from the last 30 days.

In the **Recent transactions** panel you will see your recent income and expences. You will differentiate them using the value field (for expences they are negative).
