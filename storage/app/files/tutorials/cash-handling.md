# Cash handling
This bundle allows you to monitor how much cash you have at the current moment. It will also add a feature allowing you to insert how much cash you used while entering income or outcome. To get started, go to the bundle page and set the field **Mean of payment used as cash** for the proper currency. If you don't have any means of payment like that already, go to the **Settings** page and create it. After that set how much cash you have at the current moment. The amount should correspond with how much cash it says that you have from transactions. Then when you enter your income or outcome, if you set the mean of payment which you used as cash, a window will pop up at the end of the page allowing you to enter how much cash you need to fill in to keep the right balance.
