# Starting out
Congratulations! You just created your SelfAccounting account! Here are some things that you should do to make your experience even more incredible:

## Check out light mode
To switch between dark mode and light mode, click on the icon of sun or moon in the upper-right corner of the screen and see which one works best for you. The setting you choose will be used throughout every webpage here and can be changed any time you want! Throughout all of the tutorials, I will be using the dark mode version of the page, but your choice won't have any effect on anything but the appearance of the webpage.

## Change your profile picture
To change your profile picture, click on your temporary profile picture (upper-right corner of the screen) and choose **View profile**, or click on [this link](/profile). Then click on the **Profile picture** labelled field, select your profile picture, and click **Save changes**. The page will reload and after it does you'll see your new profile picture!

## Already done self-accounting?
If you have any previous data about your self-accounting and you want it to be present in the app, please contact the developer (check out the bottom of the page), we'll see what we can do!

## When you're done
Explore this website in its entirety. The recommended way of your journey is:
1. Visit the **Settings** page and enter your categories and means of payment.
1. Visit the **Income** and **Outcome** pages and add your income and outcome. You might not have anything to enter just yet, so you can skip this step for now and return to it later.
1. Visit the **Summary** page to confirm everything is working for you.
1. Visit the **Bundles** page to look for ways to make your SelfAccounting experience even better.
