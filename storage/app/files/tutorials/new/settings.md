This view will allow you to add, edit and delete categories and means of payment.

## Categories
Categories are groups which your income and outcome splits into, for example:
- Food
- Entertainment
- Transport
- Gifts
- Sweets

Clicking on the pen in the actions column will allow you to edit the given record. There you can change its properties. To reset your changes click the reset button. To update your changes click the update button.

Clicking on the trash bin in the actions column will allow you to delete the given record. You have to confirm your decision by clicking the **Yes** button in the dialog.

### Add category
Clicking the **Add category** button will open a dialog, which will allow you to enter a new category. Fill in the fields in the dialog and if everything is correct, the **Submit** button will be green and after clicking it you will submit your category.

If count to summary is chosen, the two date fields to the right will be unlocked. This option allows you to show the outcome with this category with dates between the entered values (if value is empty then the limit doesn't apply). This option is only useful when you - for example - spent an amount of money but you are certain you will have them back in some time. Otherwise, I don't advise selecting it.

## Means of payment
Categories are ways in which you earn, hold and spend money, for example:
- Bank Account (you can use multiple bank accounts if you want to, but name them accordingly)
- Cash
- PayPal
- Credit card

Please note that all means that you enter should point to a different place where you store money, for example, if you have a debit card connected to your bank account, where you also make money transfers, enter just the **Bank account** mean of payment, instead of **Debit card** and **Money transfers**. This way, when you enter the dashboard, you will see how much money do you exactly have on each of your accounts.

Clicking on the pen in the actions column will allow you to edit the given record. There you can change its properties. To reset your changes click the reset button. To update your changes click the update button.

Clicking on the trash bin in the actions column will allow you to delete the given record. You have to confirm your decision by clicking the **Yes** button in the dialog.

### Add mean of payment
Clicking the **Add category** button will open a dialog, which will allow you to enter a new category. Fill in the fields in the dialog and if everything is correct, the **Submit** button will be green and after clicking it you will submit your category.

The **First entry date** and **Start balance** fields are the date when you started monitoring the balance and the balance you have in the given mean of payment on that day. Let's imagine a situation, where you decided to count up all your money and wrote it down somewhere. Then when you bought something, you noted down how much money you spent. The first entry date is the date when you counted the money, and the start balance is the actual amount you owned on that day. You don't know what happened to your money before that nor how much money you had before. Income and outcome can't be entered using the selected mean of payment with a date earlier than the entered one here.
