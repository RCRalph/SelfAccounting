# Accounts
Categories are ways in which you earn, hold and spend money, for example:
- Bank Account (you can use multiple bank accounts if you want to, but name them accordingly)
- Cash
- PayPal
- Credit card

Please note that all accounts that you enter should point to a different place where you store money, for example, if you have a debit card connected to your bank account, where you also make money transfers, enter just the **Bank account** account, instead of **Debit card** and **Money transfers**. This way, when you enter the dashboard, you will see how much money do you exactly have on each of your accounts.

Clicking on the pen in the actions column will allow you to edit the given record. There you can change its properties. To reset your changes click the reset button. To update your changes click the update button.

You can **archive** your account by disabling the following options:
- Show in income
- Show in expences
- Count to summary
This way your account name will still be visible in the overviews, but you will not be able to use that account any further. You can restore its functionality by enabling at least one of the options mentioned above.

Clicking on the trash bin in the actions column will allow you to delete the given record. You have to confirm your decision by clicking the **Yes** button in the dialog. Doing this isn't preferable, as it might break some of your records. For most of the users **archiving** an account will be the best option.

## Add account
Clicking the **Add category** button will open a dialog, which will allow you to enter a new category. Fill in the fields in the dialog and if everything is correct, the **Submit** button will be green and after clicking it you will submit your category.

The **Start date** and **Start balance** fields are the date when you started monitoring the balance and the balance you have in the given account on that day. Let's imagine a situation, where you decided to count up all your money and wrote it down somewhere. Then when you bought something, you noted down how much money you spent. The first entry date is the date when you counted the money, and the start balance is the actual amount you owned on that day. You don't know what happened to your money before that nor how much money you had before. Income and expences can't be entered using the selected account with a date earlier than the entered one here.
