# Bundles
Bundles allow you to expand the application with additional functions and pages. Find a bundle that's interesting to you and click on one. Then you will see the description of the bundle and pictures of it in the gallery.

## Acquiring a bundle
To acquire a bundle, you need to either purchase it by clicking the **Buy now** button or, if you are a Premium user, click the **Start using with premium** button. After you clicked the button, you should be redirected to the bundle's main page. You can also click the **Bundles** tab on the navigation bar, where a dropdown should pop up. After that click on the name of the bundle you just acquired.

# Premium
Premium mainly allows you to get access to every available bundle. The cost of it is €1.5 per month or €15 per year. 10% of all the money made from the site goes to the Wikimedia Foundation. You can read more about premium [here](/premium). Every user after registering gets 30 days of premium for free.
