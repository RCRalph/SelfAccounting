# Report management
This bundle allows you to create reports about your income and outcome for your usage or for sharing them with other SelfAccounting users. Bare in mind that you can share your reports with other users, but for them to see it, they will have to own this bundle as well (via Premium or permanently). On the main screen, you can see which reports you own and which were shared with you. Creating a report involves adding queries and additional entries to the report. If you have any questions about the bundle, contact the developer (look at the bottom of the page).
