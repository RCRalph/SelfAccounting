# Chart pack
This bundle allows you to see charts, which visually represent your self-accounting data. To set it up, go to the main page of the bundle and click **Edit chart presence**. This will redirect you to a page, where you will be able to mark which categories, means of payment etc. will be visible on the charts. After that, go to the bundle page again and click one of the charts.
