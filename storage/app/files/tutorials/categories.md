# Categories
Categories are groups which your income and outcome splits into, for example:
- Food
- Entertainment
- Transport
- Gifts
- Sweets

Clicking on the pen in the actions column will allow you to edit the given record. There you can change its properties. To reset your changes click the reset button. To update your changes click the update button.

Clicking on the trash bin in the actions column will allow you to delete the given record. You have to confirm your decision by clicking the **Yes** button in the dialog.

## Add category
Clicking the **Add category** button will open a dialog, which will allow you to enter a new category. Fill in the fields in the dialog and if everything is correct, the **Submit** button will be green and after clicking it you will submit your category.

If count to summary is chosen, the two date fields to the right will be unlocked. This option allows you to show the outcome with this category with dates between the entered values (if value is empty then the limit doesn't apply). This option is only useful when you - for example - spent an amount of money but you are certain you will have them back in some time. Otherwise, I don't advise selecting it.
