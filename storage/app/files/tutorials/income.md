# Income
If you are on this page for the first time, the only thing you will see is the text ***Nothing to see here, for now...***. This means that you haven't entered any income yet. After you do, this page should show you a table with all of your income sorted from the latest to the oldest.

At the top of this page there are three buttons:
- **Add multiple incomes** - This page allows you to enter more than one income at once.
- **Add single income** - This page allows you to enter just one income at a time.
- **Exchange means of payment** - This page allows you to enter income and outcome simultaneously, which is needed when you for example withdraw money from an ATM.

Clicking them will get you into a different webpage, which will tell you what they do and why they are here. It's important to go through all of them because this way you will realize how powerful this app is.
