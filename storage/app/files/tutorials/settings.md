# Settings
This page allows you to enter your categories and means of payment. First of all, choose your currency using the field to the right of the screen:
![Currency select statement position](/storage/tutorial/KCDGjzIaZ4SDb6MTig1jQQc1prHpg5qNBXjmHhveAhtGfbAveL.png)
The latest currency you used in income/outcome will later be used to automatically select your currency. You can add categories and means of payment for multiple currencies, just make sure you are adding them to the correct one. After that follow the instructions below. It is important to add them before entering any income or outcome because then you won't have to edit your data in the future.

## Enter categories
Categories are groups which your income/outcome splits into. Some example categories:
- Food,
- Entertainment,
- Car maintenance,
- Presents

To create new categories, click the **New category** button. A new table row will show up, which includes fields such as:
- **Name** - The name of your category, max 32 characters long. It doesn't have to be unique, but it's a good idea to have different names of your categories.
- **Income** - Should this category be an income category. If chosen, this category will show up when you add, see or edit your income.
- **Outcome** - Should this category be an outcome category. If chosen, this category will show up when you add, see or edit your outcome.
- **Summary** - If chosen, the two date fields to the right will be unlocked. This option allows you to count the outcome with this category with dates between the two dates to the right. This option is only useful when you for example spent some money but you are certain you will have them back in some time. Otherwise, I don't advise selecting it.
- **Start date** - Only available if the **Summary** option is selected. It marks the inclusive start of counting to the summary. 
- **End date** - Only available if the **Summary** option is selected. It marks the inclusive end of counting to the summary. 

To delete a category, click the trashbin to the right of the row which you want to delete.

The buttons below the table do the following things:
- **New category** - Creates a new row in the table. You can create as many categories as you like. To create categories with a different currency, just change the currency field as shown above.
- **Reset changes** - Resets changes to the latest saved categories. **Caution:** If you are entering categories for the first time, this button will delete all your work if you haven't previously saved it!
- **Save changes** - Saves your categories, so you can access them when entering income or outcome. This button also resets the checkpoint of your **Reset changes** button. This button will be disabled if there is invalid data given above. You must correct your data before you can submit it. 

## Enter means of payment
Means of payment are how you get, store and spend money. Some example means of payment:
- Bank account,
- Cash,
- PayPal

Please note that all means that you enter should point to a different place where you store money, for example, if you have a debit card connected to your bank account, where you also make money transfers, enter just the **Bank account** mean of payment, instead of **Debit card** and **Money transfers**. This way, when you enter the [summary page](/summary), you will see how much money do you exactly have, which is what this page was intended to do from the beginning.

To create new means of payment, click the **New mean of payment** button. A new table row will show up, which includes fields such as:
- **Name** - The name of your mean of payment, max 32 categories long. It doesn't have to be unique, but it's a good idea to have different names for your means of payment.
- **Income** - Should this mean of payment be an income mean of payment. If chosen, the mean of payment will show up when you add, see or edit your income.
- **Outcome** - Should this mean of payment be an outcome mean of payment. If chosen, the mean of payment will show up when you add, see or edit your outcome.
- **Summary** - Should this mean of payment be counted in the summary. If chosen, the mean of payment will show up on the [summary page](/summary).
- **First entry** - The date when you started monitoring your balance. Let's imagine a situation, where you decided to count up all your money and wrote it down somewhere. Then when you bought something or got money from somewhere, you noted down how much money you spent or got. The first entry date is the date when you counted the money. You don't know what happened to your money before that nor how much money you had before. No income or outcome can be entered using the selected mean of payment with a date earlier than the entered one here. This of course can be changed later.
- **Starting balance** - The amount, which you had when you started monitoring your balance. Please refer to the story given in the previous point. The precision of this amount is two decimal places.

To delete a mean of payment, click the trashbin to the right of the row which you want to delete.

The buttons below the table do the following things:
- **New mean of payment** - Creates a new row in the table. You can create as many means of payment as you like. To create means of payment with a different currency, just change the currency field as shown above.
- **Reset changes** - Resets changes to the latest saved means of payment. **Caution:** If you are entering means of payment for the first time, this button will delete all your work if you haven't previously saved it!
- **Save changes** - Saves your means of payment, so you can access them when entering income or outcome. This button also resets the checkpoint of your **Reset changes** button. This button will be disabled if there is invalid data given above. You must correct your data before you can submit it. 

# Caution
Remember to save your changes, otherwise all your work will be lost.
